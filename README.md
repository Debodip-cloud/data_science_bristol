ðŸ”Ž Overview:
The repository is a comprehensive collection of data science, machine learning, time series analysis, and blockchain projects. This represents my work experience at Bristol.
ðŸ“‚ Main Components:
âœ… Jupyter Notebooks:

Hands-on data science tasks such as classification, topic modelling, sequence tagging, deep learning (CNN, RNN), sentiment analysis, hypothesis testing, PCA, and hierarchical risk parity.

Time series topics include stationarity testing, ARMA/GARCH modelling, and portfolio analysis.

âœ… RMarkdown Files:

Statistical data analysis and visualization using R.

âœ… Blockchain / Smart Contracts:

Solidity smart contract examples and attacks (e.g., auction attacks, front-running, storage vulnerabilities).

âœ… Python Scripts:

Blockchain-related attack simulations.

âœ… Project Reports & Descriptions:

PDFs and markdown files explaining project work in data analytics, engineering, financial data, and blockchain security.

âœ… General Lab Worksheets and Solutions:

Weekly lab exercise answers for deep learning, hypothesis testing, and time series features.

ðŸ”— Key Themes:

Data Science & Machine Learning â€“ Applied exercises in classification, topic modelling, deep learning.

Statistical Analysis â€“ Hypothesis testing and time series analysis using Jupyter and R.

Blockchain & Smart Contracts â€“ Practical exploration of smart contract vulnerabilities and Solidity programming.

Project Documentation â€“ Reports and presentations supporting the technical work.
