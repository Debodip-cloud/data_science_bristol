    "# FTGP Week 2: Blockchain fundamentals\n",
    "\n",
    "This week, we will use the cryptographic primitives we saw last week to build our own blockchain!\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding how a typical blockchain works is a key part of understanding the benefits (and drawbacks) this technology brings. Knowing how the underling systems works, will also improve your ability to build financial applications on top of it.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be using Python and the packages we used last week, plus you might need the `cbor` (https://cbor2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) package.\n",
    "\n",
    "***Note:*** The following worksheet requires good programming skills. However, the aim of the worksheet is not to teach you how to code, but to allow you to build your own blockchain system. If you are not feeling confident in your programming abilities, you might wish to use a non-programming alternative, ETH.build (https://sandbox.eth.build/). A series of helpful videos (https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLJz1HruEnenCXH7KW7wBCEBnBLOVkiqIi) is also available to guide you throughout the process.\n",

    "- PoW. The hash of every new block's header should be less than `TARGET` (a global parameter, set now to `\\x00\\x0f\\xff\\xff\\xff\\xff...\\xff`). You also need to implement a function that finds the appropriate block nonce for each block.\n",
    "- Forks and their handling. Modify your implementation, such that `add()` allows to anchor a new block to any given existing block. Implement the `resolve()` method, that returns the longest chain (e.g., it can return the latest block of the longest chain). \n",
    "- At the moment, our blockchain system doesn't perform any checks on the transactions. Modify your block implementation so that each block contains a record of user accounts (i.e. mapping from public keys to balances). Then create a method that makes sure that a transaction is valid (given the block's user record) before adding it to the block. Otherwise the transaction should be discarded without any state changes. Also add a method to your blockchain class to validate that the record of each block is consistent. Make sure that the accounts are matching the ones in the previous block and that the transactions of the block are executed correctly.\n",
    "- Add checks to your blockchain class to make sure that any block that is added to the blockchain is valid.\n",

    "**Potential Hints:**\n",
    "- The Coinbase transaction. Introduce a new special transaction, where the miner who found a new block is rewarded with 100 coins. \n",
    "    - This can be achieved by adding a new function to the transaction class. Make sure that you select an appropriate sender (e.g 0x0 or None) and that you account for this is your validation method.\n",
    "- Make sure that only one such transaction can be included per block.\n",
    "    - This is a bit more tricky. You need to add a check in your blockchain class that makes sure that only one transaction is the coinbase (a simple boolean would work). You can distinguish the coinbase transaction as it will have a special sender.\n",
    "- PoW. The hash of every new block's header should be less than `TARGET` (a global parameter, set now to `\\x00\\x0f\\xff\\xff\\xff\\xff...\\xff`). \n",
    "    - You can easily check this by adding a check in your blockchain class that checks that the hash is less than the `TARGET`.\n",
    "- Write a function that finds the appropriate block nonce for PoW.\n",
    "    - This should just be a simple function that tries many nonces (using the `get_hash` method) and returns the first nonce that works.\n",
    "- Forks and their handling. Modify your implementation, such that `add()` allows to anchor a new block to any given existing block. \n",
    "    - This is again tricky. I think the easiest way to achieve this is to have a field in each block that points to its parent block. This field will be populated in the blockchain class. Finally you can keep a list of all the endpoints of forks in your blockchain class. If a new block doesn't attach to one of the endpoints, then starting with each endpoint, you can go back (to its parent) until you find the block that it attaches to. In this case, you have a fork so you need to include this new block in your list of endpoints. \n",
    "- Implement the `resolve()` method, that returns the longest chain (e.g., it can return the latest block of the longest chain). \n",
    "    - This can be done easily by checking all the endpoints of forks and selecting the one with the highest block number.\n",
    "- At the moment, our blockchain system doesn't perform any checks on the transactions (apart from verifying the signature). Modify your block implementation so that each block contains a record of user accounts (i.e. mapping from public keys to balances).\n",
    "    - This can be done by adding a `balances` dictionary in every block. Then when a new block is created, you copy the balances from the previous block and use that as your starting point.\n",
    "- Then create a method that makes sure that a transaction is valid (given the block's user record) before adding it to the block. Otherwise the transaction should be discarded without any state changes.\n",
    "    - For each transaction that you are adding to the block, make sure that the sender has enough coins. Then change the balances of the sender and receiver. After you process all the transactions, you should end up with the new balances dictionary that you can attach to your new block.\n",
    "- At the moment, transactions can be repeated. Add a counter associated with each account that makes each transaction unique.\n",
    "    - This is similar to the balances. Add a `counts` dictionary in each Block that keeps a counter for every sender. Then modify the transaction class so that a counter field is included. When creating a new transaction make sure to get the counter from the previous block for every sender and include it in your transaction.\n",
    "- Finally, add a method to your blockchain class to validate that the accounts (balances and counters) of each block. Make sure that the accounts and matching the ones in the previous block after the transactions of the block.\n",
    "    - This should validate the previous two dictionaries. Starting with the values in the previous block, you can update the balances and counters with each transaction that's included in the new block and then at the end, check if the dictionaries you have created match the ones present in the new block."
